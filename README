'trm.ucm' is a Python module for reading and writing Ultracam
ucm files to allow access to the guts of Ultracam files via Python.

Look in 'scripts' for some example scripts. This is an early version 
and there may well be changes in the future, in particular to the 
currently crude way the headers are handled.

Installation:

As well as standard Python, you need 'numpy' (http://numpy.scipy.org/),  
'scipy' (http://www.scipy.org/) and 'ppgplot'. The last one seems difficult 
to get hold of so I have made copy available which can be downloaded from
http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/software/ppgplot-0.99.tar.gz

Look out for rpms or equivalent for 'numpy' and 'scipy'; on SuSe linux
installation of scipy was not entirely straightforward so pre-packaged
installations for your system might help.


Once everything is ready installation in the usual

python setup.py install --prefix=your_top_levl_installation_directory
