'trm.ucm' is a Python module for reading, writing and modifying
Ultracam ucm files.

Look in 'scripts' for some example scripts. If you have not used this 
before, DON'T -- it has been superceded by trm.ultracam

For installation you need numpy, ppgplot (my version from:

 http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/software/ppgplot-0.99.tar.gz

and trm.subs, another of my python packages.

Once everything is ready, install with the usual

python setup.py install --prefix=your_top_level_installation_directory
