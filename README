'trm.ucm' is a Python module for reading, writing and modifying
Ultracam ucm files.

Look in 'scripts' for some example scripts. This is a beta version 
and there may well be changes in the future, in particular to the 
currently crude way the headers are handled.

Installation:

As well as standard Python, you need 'numpy' (http://numpy.scipy.org/),
'ppgplot' and another Python pacakage of mine, trm.subs. ppgplot seems
difficult to get hold of so I have made copy available which can be downloaded
from http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/software/ppgplot-0.99.tar.gz

Once everything is ready, install with the usual

python setup.py install --prefix=your_top_level_installation_directory
